# mat-to-csv-web
This tool was developed by Filip Arnaut from the Institute of Physics Belgrade, University of Belgrade, as part of the research paper titled:

"Multi-Class Machine Learning Classification of Ionospheric VLF Data Anomaly Detection: Dataset and Framework"

The tool enables users who have downloaded .mat (MATLAB) ionospheric VLF amplitude data from Waldo World to quickly and easily convert the data into a CSV file compatible with the TRAINSET format- a browser-based tool for data labeling/classification.
